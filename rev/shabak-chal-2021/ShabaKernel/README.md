A special linux binary format was used for running an application. It's handler (kernel module) is given as well. After analysing and reverse engineering the kernel module I've been able to debug the loading logic from a kernel debugger and deduce the entry point of the application (now i was able to dump it as well becaue its encrypted on disk). Finally I was able to reverse the flag generation algorithem - and deduce the correct flag. I will add a detailed writeup in the future.
